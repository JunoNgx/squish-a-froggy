## Description

A fun exercise I found at work to re-create [an overly glamourous front-end implementation](https://twitter.com/jh3yy/status/1652077061530329089), with my own artistic spin.

Another fun thing I did at work, inspired by [a suggestion](https://codepen.io/parcon/full/xqVYmB) from a co-worker.
